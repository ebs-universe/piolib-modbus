/**
  * \brief MODBUS Layer 2/3 Helper function to validate the recieved message
  * 
  * This function validates the message currently in the modbus_rxbuf. It 
  * verifies the CRC, confirms the address is relevant to this slave. 
  * It returns 1 for a valid message and 0 for an invalid one. This 
  * function also increments the appropriate counters. 
  * 
  * The command length is not validated here, and should be previously
  * verified using the crlen handlers.
  * 
  * If layer 2/3 gets a zero from here, it should discard the packet. If it 
  * recieves 1, it should then call modbus_process_command() so that the 
  * library can handle the message.
